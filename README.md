**E-Commerce Platform
**
This project is an e-commerce platform developed using Spring Boot and follows the microservice architecture. It comprises multiple services, including User, Product, Order, and Payment services, each independently deployed and managed. The platform provides features like microservice-based modularity and scalability, RESTful APIs for inter-service communication, secure payment handling, role-based authentication and authorization, and comprehensive logging and exception handling.

The platformâ€™s architecture is designed around the microservice model, where each service focuses on a specific domain. Communication between these services is achieved using REST APIs. The major components include the User Service for handling user-related operations such as authentication, registration, and profile management; the Product Service for managing product listings, inventory, and categories; the Order Service for processing orders, tracking their statuses, and maintaining order history; and the Payment Service for integrating with payment gateways and managing transactions. Optionally, a gateway service can route requests to the appropriate services, and a centralized configuration server can handle service configurations.

The technologies utilized include Java as the core programming language, Spring Boot for service development, Spring Cloud for microservice tools, Hibernate/JPA for database interactions, MySQL as the database, Postman for API testing, Docker for containerization, and Swagger for API documentation. The project also emphasizes future scalability and enhancements, including the addition of centralized configuration management, caching with Redis, enhanced security using OAuth2 or JWT, and scaling services using Kubernetes.

The platform consists of several modules:

User Service handles endpoints for user registration, authentication, and retrieving user details.

Product Service manages endpoints for fetching, adding, and updating product details.

Order Service processes orders, retrieves order details, and updates order statuses.

Payment Service integrates payment processing and retrieves payment information.

To set up and run the platform, the repository can be cloned, databases for each service can be configured in MySQL, and services can be built and executed using Maven commands. Optionally, Docker support is provided to build images and deploy services using Docker Compose. API endpoints are documented via Swagger UI for easy testing and integration. Future enhancements aim to improve performance and security while introducing modern infrastructure practices for greater scalability.
