Features

Microservice architecture for modularity and scalability.

RESTful APIs for inter-service communication.

Database integration with JPA and Hibernate.

Secure payment handling.

Role-based authentication and authorization.

Comprehensive logging and exception handling.

Architecture

The platform follows a microservice architecture, where each service is responsible for a specific domain. The communication between services is achieved using REST APIs. The architecture includes the following components:

User Service: Handles user authentication, registration, and profile management.

Product Service: Manages product listings, inventory, and categories.

Order Service: Processes orders, tracks order statuses, and maintains order history.

Payment Service: Integrates with payment gateways to handle transactions.

A gateway service can also be added to route requests to appropriate services, and a centralized configuration server can manage service configurations.

Technologies Used

Java: Core programming language.

Spring Boot: Framework for building services.

Spring Cloud: Tools for microservice development.

Hibernate/JPA: ORM for database interactions.

MySQL: Relational database.

Postman: API testing tool.

Docker: Containerization.

Swagger: API documentation.
